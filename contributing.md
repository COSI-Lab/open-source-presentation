# Contributing to Open Source

Contributing to Open Source allows people to be able to give back and help
out on projects that they use frequenty. Tasks such as writing documentation,
finding and/or fixing bugs in the source code, and helping develop features
for a project help increase one's role in the open source community.

## Before you begin

Just as a warning, this guide highly focuses on using Git and GitHub, two
large systems for managing open source software. This does not focus on
non-distributed version control systems such as Subversion. Even though this
focuses on Github, many subjects explained below are also relevant on other
sites that also support Git such as Bitbucket.

## Where to find projects

Many widely known projects such as Firefox and VLC are open sourced and welcome
contributions from newcomers. Sites such as GitHub or Bitbucket allow software
to be hosted on Repositories and shared with the world.

If there is a project that one uses frequently, it's possible to contribute
to such project, although it's recommended to view if the Repository has
a contributing file or license so one knows what they are allowed to do.

If the project allows outside contributions, one is ready to help out.

## How to contribute

There are multiple ways of improving Open Source Software. A few of the main
ways include writing or fixing documentation, posting bugs or feature requests,
and even fixing part of the code itself. On GitHub, there is a button in the
top corner of every repository that says Fork. By default a normal user can't
edit code in repositories other than their own or ones they have permission to
edit. Forking a repository allows the creation of personal copies of the
repository on your own GitHub account so you can make changes to the codebase.

## Issues

If someone has a problem with a piece of Open Source Software, they can post
issues to the project's repository or a specified bug tracker, depending on
the size of the project. The issues can include a bug discovered in the code,
a feature that seems relevant to the codebase that would be useful if added,
or a feature that may be confusing to understand and could be restructured
to be easier to use.

Users are allowed to either post an issue, or view and help fix an issue in
the repo. These issues are threads that allow discussions on ways to fix
bugs in software or make a better understanding on how the project works.

## Documentation

Documentation is a helpful resource when developing Open Source Software.
Documenting a project allows users to understand its purpose and how to
use it. A simple way of contributing to a project is either modifying or
adding documentation. If a feature is undocumented, one can write about
its usage. Note that one should write in the style of existing documentation to
keep the style of the entire documentation consistent. After writing or
editing documentation, a contributor can submit it to the maintainers
as a Pull Request, which is explained below. 

## Branching and Pull Requests

A convention that some people use when working on projects is to have a
single branch of the codebase that is stable and different branches for
adding new features to the repository. By default, a repository has a
master branch when created, while other branches need to be created
seperately.

Say a user found a bug or wants to add some form of documentation in
someone's repository, they can fork that repo to their own account, either
work on the code in the master branch or in a new branch, and fix the issue.
Once it is tested to work, they can either merge the seperate branch to their
local master, if a seperate branch was used, and then prepare to send the
code to the official repo. This process is called a Pull Request, which
consists of pushing the files you added or modified to the offical repo, and
a description of why it should be added to the project. The maintainer then
can either discuss any changes needed, and if he or she feels that the
modification is okay, they can close the pull request and merge the files
into the official codebase.

## Other ways of contributing to communities and projects

Other than the ways included above, there are plenty of other ways to give back
to these projects. Many projects may have forums, user groups, mailing lists,
and/or chatrooms to allow informal discussions on these projects. Helping other
members of the community with their questions and issues is also resourceful
since nobody is an expert on everything, but collectively, communities around
Open Source Software are happy to help out with any concerns.
