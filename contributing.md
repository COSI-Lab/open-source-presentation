# Contributing to Open Source

Contributing to Open Source allows people to be able to give back and help
contribute to projects that they use frequenty. Whether adding a feature
to a project, fixing a bug, or adding documentation, it allows communities
to form out of these projects.

## Where to find projects

Many widely known projects are open sourced and available to be contributed
by members of the community. Sites such as Github or Bitbucket allow software
to be hosted on Repositories and shared with the world.

If there is a project that one uses frequently, it's possible to contribute
to such project, although it's recommended to view if the Repository has
a contributing file or license so one knows what they are allowed to do.

If the project allows outside contributions, one is ready to help out.

## How to contribute

There are multiple ways of improving Open Source Software. A few of the main
ways include writing of fixing documentation, posting bugs or feature requests,
and even fixing part of the code itself. On Github, there is a button in the
top corner of every repository that says Fork. By default a normal user can't
edit code in repositories other than their own or ones they have permission to
edit. Forking a repository allows the creation of personal copies of the
repository on your own Github account so you can make changes to the codebase.

## Issues

If someone has a problem with a piece of Open Source Software, they can add
issues to the project's Github Repo or a specified bug tracker, depending on
the size of the project. The issues can include a bug discovered in the code,
a feature that seems relevant to the codebase that would be useful if added,
or a feature that may be confusing to understand and could be restructured
to be easier to use.

Users are allowed to either post an issue, or view and help fix an issue in
the repo.
