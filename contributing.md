# Contributing to Open Source

Contributing to Open Source allows people to be able to give back and help
out on projects that they use frequenty. Whether adding a feature
to a project, fixing a bug, or adding documentation, it allows communities
to form out of these projects.

## Where to find projects

Many widely known projects such as Firefox and VLC are open sourced and welcome
contributions from newcomers.Sites such as GitHub or Bitbucket allow software
to be hosted on Repositories and shared with the world.

If there is a project that one uses frequently, it's possible to contribute
to such project, although it's recommended to view if the Repository has
a contributing file or license so one knows what they are allowed to do.

If the project allows outside contributions, one is ready to help out.

## How to contribute

There are multiple ways of improving Open Source Software. A few of the main
ways include writing or fixing documentation, posting bugs or feature requests,
and even fixing part of the code itself. On GitHub, there is a button in the
top corner of every repository that says Fork. By default a normal user can't
edit code in repositories other than their own or ones they have permission to
edit. Forking a repository allows the creation of personal copies of the
repository on your own GitHub account so you can make changes to the codebase.

## Issues

If someone has a problem with a piece of Open Source Software, they can add
issues to the project's repository or a specified bug tracker, depending on
the size of the project. The issues can include a bug discovered in the code,
a feature that seems relevant to the codebase that would be useful if added,
or a feature that may be confusing to understand and could be restructured
to be easier to use.

Users are allowed to either post an issue, or view and help fix an issue in
the repo. These issues are threads that allow discussions on ways to fix
bugs in software or make a better understanding on how the project works.

## Documentation

A resource that allows users of a piece of software to understand how to use
it is the documentation. documentation consists of an overview of what the 
sofware is, how to install and use the it, common issues and troubleshooting,
and ways of contributing to the project. These documents are not final products
and are often updated to include more information to contributors or users of
the project or to make the current documentation easier to understand.
contributors are often able to contribute to this documentation and help out
the maintainers of the project, and the process is explained in the next section.

## Branching and Pull Requests

A convention that some people use when working on projects is to have a
single branch of the codebase that is stable and different branches for
adding new features to the repository. By default, a repository has a
master branch when created, while other branches need to be created
seperately.

Say a user found a bug or wants to add some form of documentation in
someone's repository, they can fork that repo to their own account, either
work on the code in the master branch or in a new branch, and fix the issue.
Once it is tested to work, they can either merge the seperate branch to their
local master, if a seperate branch was used, and then prepare to send the
code to the official repo. This process is called a Pull Request, which
consists of pushing the files you added or modified to the offical repo, and
a description of why it should be added to the project. The maintainer then
can either discuss any changes needed, and if he or she feels that the
modification is okay, they can close the pull request and merge the files
into the official codebase.

## Other ways of contributing to communities and projects

Other than the ways included above, there are plenty of other ways to give back
to these projects. Many projects may have forums, user groups, mailing lists, and/or
chatrooms to allow informal discussions on these projects. Helping other
members of the community with their questions and issues is also resourceful
since nobody is an expert on everything, but collectively, communities around
Open Source Software are happy to help out with any concerns.
